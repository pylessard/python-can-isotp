Implementation
==============

This sections explains the python implementation of the IsoTP protocol.

Transport layer
---------------

Depending on your constraints, you may want to have the IsoTP protocol layer to run in Python (in the user space). For example, if you want to rely on `python-can <https://python-can.readthedocs.io/>`_ for the support of your CAN interface, you will need to run the IsoTP layer in Python.

In such case, the :class:`isotp.TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` will be the right tool. One must first define functions to access the hardware and provide them to the :class:`isotp.TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` as parameters named ``rxfn`` and ``txfn``.

.. autoclass:: isotp.TransportLayer

If python-can must be used as CAN layer, one can use the :class:`isotp.CanStack<isotp.CanStack>` which extends the TransportLayer object with predefined functions that calls python-can. 

.. autoclass:: isotp.CanStack

The CAN messages going in and out from the transport layer are defined with :class:`isotp.CanMessage<isotp.CanMessage>`. 

.. autoclass:: isotp.CanMessage

.. _parameters:

Parameters
----------

The transport layer ``params`` parameter must be a dictionary with the following keys.

.. _param_stmin:

.. attribute:: stmin
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 0**

   The single-byte Separation Time to include in the flow control message that the layer will send when receiving data. 
   Refer to ISO-15765-2 for specific values. From 1 to 127, represents milliseconds. From 0xF1 to 0xF9, represents hundreds of microseconds (100us, 200us, ..., 900us). 0 Means no timing requirements

.. _param_blocksize:

.. attribute:: blocksize
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 8**

   The single-byte Block Size to include in the flow control message that the layer will send when receiving data.
   Represents the number of consecutive frames that a sender should send before expecting the layer to send a flow control message. 0 means infinitely large block size (implying no flow control message)

.. _param_tx_data_length:

.. attribute:: tx_data_length
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 8**

   The maximum number of bytes that the Link Layer (CAN layer) can transport. In other words, the biggest number of data bytes possible in a single CAN message.
   Valid values are : 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64.
   
   Large frames will be transmitted in small CAN messages of this size except for the last CAN message that will be as small as possible, unless padding is used. 

   This parameter was formely named ``ll_data_length`` but has been renamed to explicitly indicate that it affects transmitted messages only.

.. _param_tx_data_min_length:

.. attribute:: tx_data_min_length
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: None**

   Sets the minimum length of CAN messages. Message with less data than this value will be padded using ``tx_padding`` byte or ``0xCC`` if ``tx_padding=None``. 

   When set to ``None``, CAN messages will be as small as possible unless ``tx_data_length=8`` and ``tx_padding != None``; in that case, all CAN messages will be padded up to 8 bytes to be compliant with ISO-15765.

   Valid values are : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 48, 64.
   
.. _param_squash_stmin_requirement:

.. attribute:: squash_stmin_requirement
   :annotation: (bool)

   **default: False**

   Indicates if the layer should override the receiver separation time (stmin) when sending and try sending as fast as possible instead.
   This can be useful when the layer is running on an operating system giving low priority to your application; such as Windows that has a thread resolution of 16ms.

.. _param_rx_flowcontrol_timeout:

.. attribute:: rx_flowcontrol_timeout
   
   **default: 1000**

   The number of milliseconds to wait for a flow control frame before stopping reception and triggering a :class:`FlowControlTimeoutError<isotp.FlowControlTimeoutError>`.
   Defined as **N_BS** bs ISO-15765-2

.. _param_rx_consecutive_frame_timeout:

.. attribute:: rx_consecutive_frame_timeout
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 1000**

   The number of milliseconds to wait for a consecutive frame before stopping reception and triggering a :class:`ConsecutiveFrameTimeoutError<isotp.ConsecutiveFrameTimeoutError>`.
   Defined as **N_CS** by ISO-15765-2

.. _param_tx_padding:

.. attribute:: tx_padding
   :annotation: (int or None)

   **default: None**

   When not ``None`` represents the byte used for padding messages sent. No padding applied when ``None`` unless ``tx_data_min_length`` is set or CAN FD mandatory padding is required.

.. _param_wftmax:

.. attribute:: wftmax
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 0**

   The single-byte Wait Frame Max to include in the flow control message that the layer will send when receiving data. 
   When this limits is reached, reception will stop and trigger a :class:`MaximumWaitFrameReachedError<isotp.MaximumWaitFrameReachedError>`

   A value of 0 means that wait frames are not supported and none shall be sent.

.. _param_max_frame_size:

.. attribute:: max_frame_size
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 4095**

   The maximum frame length that the stack will accept to receive. ISO-15765-2:2016 allows frames as long as 2^32-1 (4294967295 bytes). When a FirstFrame is sent with a length longer than ``max_frame_size``, the message will be ignored, a FlowControl message with FlowStaus=2 (Overflow) will be sent and a :class:`FrameTooLongError<isotp.FrameTooLongError>` will be triggered.

   This parameter mainly is a protection to avoid crashes due to lack of memory (caused by an external device).

.. _param_can_fd:

.. attribute:: can_fd
   :annotation: (bool)

   **default: False**

   When set to ``True``, transmitted messages will be CAN FD. CAN 2.0 when ``False``.

   Setting this parameter to ``True`` does not change the behaviour of the :class:`TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` except that outputted message will have their ``is_fd`` property set to ``True``. This parameter is just a convenience to integrate more easily with python-can


.. _param_bitrate_switch:

.. attribute:: bitrate_switch
   :annotation: (bool)

   **default: False**

   When set to ``True``, tx message will have a flag ``bitrate_switch`` marked as ``True``, meaning that the underlying layer shall performe a CAN FD bitrate switch after arbitration phase.

   Setting this parameter to ``True`` does not change the behaviour of the :class:`TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` except that outputted message will have their ``bitrate_switch`` property set to ``True``. This parameter is just a convenience to integrate more easily with python-can


.. _param_default_target_address_type:

.. attribute:: default_target_address_type
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: Physical (0)**

   When using the :meth:`TransportLayer.send<isotp.TransportLayer.send>` method without specifying ``target_address_type``, the value in this field will be used.
   The purpose of this parameter is to easily switch the address type if your program is not calling `send` directly; for example, if you use a library
   that interact with the :class:`TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` object (such as a UDS client).

   Can either be :class:`Physical (0)<isotp.TargetAddressType>` or :meth:`Functional (1)<isotp.TargetAddressType>`


.. _param_rate_limit_enable:

.. attribute:: rate_limit_enable
   :annotation: (bool)

   **default: False**

   Enable or disable the rate limiter. When disabled, no throttling is done on the output rate. When enabled, extra wait states are added in between CAN message tranmission to meet ``rate_limit_max_bitrate``

   Refer to :ref:`Rate Limiter Section<rate_limiter_section>` for more details

.. _param_rate_limit_max_bitrate:

.. attribute:: rate_limit_max_bitrate
   :annotation: (int)

   **default: 10000000 b/s**

   Defines the target bitrate in Bits/seconds that the TranportLayer object should try to respect. This rate limiter only apply to the data of the output messages. 

   Refer to :ref:`Rate Limiter Section<rate_limiter_section>` for more details


.. _param_rate_limit_window_size:

.. attribute:: rate_limit_window_size
   :annotation: (float)

   **default: 0.2 sec**

   Time window used to compute the rate limit. The rate limiter algorithm works with a sliding time window. This parameter defines the width of the window.
   The rate limiter ensure that no more than N bits is sent within the moving window where N=(rate_limit_max_bitrate*rate_limit_window_size).

   This value should be at least 50 msec for reliable behavior.

   Refer to :ref:`Rate Limiter Section<rate_limiter_section>` for more details


.. _param_listen_mode:

.. attribute:: listen_mode
   :annotation: (bool)

   **default: False**

   When Listen Mode is enabled, the :class:`TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` will correctly receive and transmit ISO-TP Frame, but will not send Flow Control
   message when receiving a frame. This mode of operation is usefull to listen to a transmission between two third-party devices without interferring.

.. _rate_limiter_section:

Rate Limiter
------------

The :class:`isotp.TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` transmission rate limiter is a feature that allows to do some throttling on the output data rate. It works with a simple sliding window and
keeps the total amount of bits sent during that time window below the maximum allowed.

.. image:: assets/rate_limiter.png
    :width: 600px
    :align: center

The maximum of bits allowed during the moving time window is defined by the product of ``rate_limit_max_bitrate`` and ``rate_limit_window_size``. 
For example, if the target bitrate is 1000b/s and the window size is 0.1sec, then the rate limiter will keep to total amount of bits during a window of 0.1 sec below 100bits.

It is important to understand that this product also defines the maximum burst size that the :class:`isotp.TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` object will output, and this is actually the original problem the
rate limiter is intended to fix (See `issue #61 <https://github.com/pylessard/python-can-isotp/issues/61>`_). Consider the case where a big payload of 10000 bytes must be transmitted, 
after the transmission of the FirstFrame, the receiving party sends a FlowControl message with BlockSize=0 and STMin=0. In that situation, the whole payload can be sent immediately
but writing 10000 bytes in a single burst might be too much for the CAN driver to handle and may overflow its internal buffer.  In
this situation, it is useful to use the rate limiter to reduces the strain on the driver internal buffer.

In the above scenario, having a bitrate of 80000 bps and a window size of 0.1 sec would make the :class:`isotp.TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` output a burst of 8000 bits (1000 bytes) every 0.1 seconds.

.. warning:: The bitrate defined by :ref:`rate_limit_max_bitrate<param_rate_limit_max_bitrate>` represent the bitrate of the CAN payload that goes out of the :class:`isotp.TransportLayer<isotp.TransportLayer>` object only, 
    the CAN layer overhead is exluded. 
    Knowing the a classical CAN message with 11bits ID and a payload of 64 bits usually have 111 bits, the extra 47 bits of overhead will not be considered by the rate limiter. This means
    that even if the rate limiter is requested to keep a steady 10kbps, depending on the CAN layer configuration, the effective hardware bitrate measured might be much more significant, from 1 to 1.5x more.

.. warning::    Bitrate is achieved by adding extra wait states which normally translate into OS calls to ``Sleep()``. 
    Because an OS scheduler has a time resolution, bitrate accuracy will be poor if the specified bitrate is very low or if the window size is very small.

Errors
------

When calling ``TransportLayer.process``, no exception should raise. Still, errors are possible and are given to an error handler provided by the user. 
An error handler should be a callable function that expects an Exception as first parameter.

.. function:: my_error_handler(error)

   :param error: The error
   :type error: :class:`isotp.IsoTpError<isotp.IsoTpError>`
