.. _Socket:

IsoTp Sockets
=============

Introduction
------------

Under Linux, CAN interfaces can be managed the same way as network interfaces. The support for each CAN driver is written directly in the Linux kernel, inside a module called SocketCAN. Therefore, it is possible to send data over CAN through sockets, which offer a unique interface for all CAN drivers.

SocketCAN allows a user the send CAN messages on the CAN layer and, starting from Linux 5.10.0, ISO-TP frames as well. Meaning that a user can write a payload into an ISO-TP socket, this payload will be subdivided into multiple CAN messages and sent to a receiver following the ISO-15765 standard

For version prior to 5.10.0, this `out-of-tree loadable kernel module <https://github.com/hartkopp/can-isotp>`_  can be compiled and loaded in the Linux kernel, enabling ISO-TP sockets.

A socket is a standard interface for communication protocols and as anything generic, it can be complex to configure. The ``isotp.socket``  is a wrapper over a native IsoTP socket providing a friendly and pythonic interface for easy configuration. It does not offer any additional functionality that your operating system can't provide, it makes the syntax clean and warns you in case of wrong usage.


Troubleshooting
---------------

 - **My socket module does not include the ``CAN_ISOTP`` constant**
 
That means that your Python version does not include support for IsoTP protocol. It should be included starting from Python 3.7, under Linux build only. See `Python issue <https://bugs.python.org/issue30987>`_ and `Pull request <https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/2956>`_

 - **When I create the socket, I get `OSError [errno XX] : Protocol not supported`.**
 
Your Linux kernel does not support ISO-TP sockets, you need to manually load it. 
Follow the steps given it the `out-of-tree repository <https://github.com/hartkopp/can-isotp>`_. You needs to compile the module, install the `.ko` file and then run `insmod can-isotp.ko` as Super User. Then your OS will accept to create an ISO-TP sockets.

 - **I get a timeout when calling send().**
 
A normal use case for that issue is that the receiver failed to respond with a flow control message.

Also, some kernel versions have been hit with `a bug <https://lore.kernel.org/linux-can/04fd32bc-b1c4-b9c3-3f8b-7987704a1f85@hartkopp.net/T/#m9615a4ecbdb742749886af73414e476498c93d51>`_. 
A race condition within the isotp kernel module can cause the send() function to return an unexpected timeout. The patch has been published in `this PR <https://lore.kernel.org/linux-can/96d31e8c-fa26-4e32-4c36-768981f20a54@hartkopp.net/T/#u>`_.
This `github issue <https://github.com/pylessard/python-udsoncan/issues/178>`_ also covers the matter
